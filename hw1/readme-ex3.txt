After getting to a very large number of n you get issues with very large values of n. After this point printf displays a value of infinity. Because of the way doubles are stored in memory you lose precision around n = 23 (for base 10). This is because double precision values are stored as decimals and exponents and when the numbers get too high the decimal part of the number (which determines the lower digits of the number) will get cut off.
